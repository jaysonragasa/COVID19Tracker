# COVID19Tracker
A cross-platform #COVID19 case tracker application that works on Android and iOS and as well as in WPF and UWP using their native XAML. Although Xamarin.Forms supports WPF and UWP, I still use the native XAML in WPF and UWP. With this reason, I could still practice WPF and UWP. Xamarin XAML and Blend XAML are somehow the same but there are differences.
